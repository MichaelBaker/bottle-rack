Bottle Rack
===========

Problem: Making a variety of cocktails causes you to accumulate a lot of different bottles of alcohol. So many that storage becomes a problem. I want to maximize the number of bottles that can be stored per square foot while still being accessible.

Existing Solutions
------------------

### Wine Rack

These don't work because spirit bottles come in a wide range of shapes and sizes. Wine racks assume you're storing standard wine-shaped bottles. They also store bottles with the top facing you, which doesn't work for spirits because you often need to see the side of the bottle or the label in order to find what you want.

### Shelving

Standard shelves tend to be too deep, which means you either store the bottles in multiple layers per shelf or waste a lot of horizontal space. Storing the bottles in layers is bad because it makes the bottles both difficult to see and you have to move bottles out of the way to get to the ones at the back. Standard shelves also don't have enough space between them to store tall bottles.

### Bar Cabinet

These tend to be geared at storing glasses more than bottles. There aren'e enough shelves and the shelves aren't tall enough.

### Bar Cart

This is the best solution I've seen so far. It's essentially a low table with all of the bottles sitting on top, which means you can see all of the bottles because you're looking down on them. You can also grab any bottle easily for the same reason. It also accomodates any bottle because it's a simple horizontal surface.

### Skinny Shelf

This is just a standard shelf with two modifications.

1. It's shallower, so it takes up less floor space and only has space for one layer of bottles per shelf.
2. Each shelf has bars to ensure the bottles are secure.

Pros:

* No moving parts
* Easy to expand storage with multiple shelves
* Reduces floor footprint
* Easy to get bottles
* Can be taller than most solutions

Cons:

* Uses up more wall space
* You can't trade off floor space for wall space
* You might start to look like a psychopath if a huge portion of your livingroom wall is displaying spirits.
* There's no top surface for housing really weird bottles or other tools
